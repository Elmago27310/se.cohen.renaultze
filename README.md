# RenaultZE - Handle your Renault Zoe in Homey

Add support to check status on your Renault Zoe and handle pre-heating.
Should work on these, but only tested with "ZOE phase 2".
- ZOE phase 1 (X101VE)
- ZOE phase 2 (X102VE)

Note that the app is built on the unoffical Reanult API and it can change without notice and stop working, if changes happen I will try to act quick to follow the changes.

Ideas, help developing and such, reach out to me on Github: https://github.com/joco73/se.cohen.renaultze

You need to have an active and working account, if it works in your normal Reanult App - it should work here too, use the credentials you have and during paring select the veichle you want to pair with help by the VIN-number.

Works with Homey FW >=5.0.0 And SDK 3.

Thanks to the guys behind these projects and blogs to help figure out how the Renault API works (or do not work):
